								<p style="text-align: justify; color:darkslategray">Arguably the Magnum Opus of Donna Tartt, who is known best for her novel “The Secret History”, the Goldfinch is a spellbinding tale of loss, grief, trauma, broken promises and bad choices, where we confront reality and the cycle of ruin passed down by the own hands that raised us. 
                                    The plot, save the very start of the book that in classic Tartt fashion shows us the end of the story, linearly, in an almost painstakingly close way, follows the life of Theodore Decker, after his mother died unexpectedly in a bombing attempt at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Having survived the attack, and in a bewildered state, Theo took one of the famous paintings—the Goldfinch. The real goldfinch painting is currently housed in the collection of Mauritshuis in the Hague, Netherlands, which, perhaps not so coincidentally, is where the final chapters of the book take place. As we progress with Theo’s life, we see him struggle to reconcile with his mother’s death, his life with his childhood best friend Andy and his family which took him in, and his negligent father’s lifestyle in Las Vegas, forcing him to relocate from New York City, and all the relationships and decisions he took after that leads to his life spiralling down further and further, as well as having one famous painting with him at all times.
                                    Perhaps above all, the relationship formed in the novel between the characters, the one that drew me in the most was that of Theo and the painting. He had taken the painting in a state of confusion, unsure of the world and having something to cling to. But that was the only time the painting was a source of comfort and more times than not it provided him the greatest amount of anxiety in his life, never allowing him moments of comfort long enough before he began to worry, and the main reason for the calamity of the final act. Yet, he seems to have an obsession with the painting that makes him unable to part with the threat which he chooses to keep close to himself. Across airports, bus rides, Las Vegas New York and eventually Amsterdam, it was the painting (or so he thought) that was the one constant in his life. In a way, the painting had become his one grasp on normalcy, and in relation, his mother. Theo’s way of holding onto the memory of his mother, whose death is so abstract he did not ever get to see her body, was to hold onto the painting. The Goldfinch is a real item from the event that took away the most important person in his life, and to make sense of it all, he could never let the painting go. In a way, Theo never left the museum. He walks through his life drugged, wondering as if viewing the works of other people, never creating his own painting even after a blank canvas was given to him many times. He is still wandering the halls of the met, waiting to find a painting that he likes, but he is never sure if he will find something quite brilliant as the lost childhood he shared with his mother.
                                    Through this, he begins to behave much like his father. Drug abuse, and illegal means of making money, are all traits shown clearly from his father. As much as he despises the man, there is no doubt that Theo is forever haunted by half of his bloodline, and his responses to life’s events are directly that of his father. Too cowardly to face his issues, too shrewd to not attempt to play games with fate and too powerless to face the consequences when life comes crashing down. He is forever chasing his mother’s shadow while his father’s bones cling onto him, and for that Theo finds himself making friends with the likes of Hobie, Pippa and Boris alike. Characters of wildly different lives that bring out simultaneously the best and worst of him. But we can talk about Theo’s relationships forever, as the 800-page book did nothing but that. He and Kitsy’s marriage, and his friendship with the Barbours before and after leaving New York. The list goes on and on.
                                    I walked into the Goldfinch having read The Secret History, and I was shocked at Donna Tartt’s range of a completely different style of storytelling. There is no great tension in the plot or much secrecy apart from one big reveal. The story is focused on Theo and Theo alone, unlike how the main protagonist of The Secret History is anything but important in the plot. Yet the reader always has a sense that they cannot reach Theo, that he is always just out of their reach. His life seemingly verging on relatable and yet unfathomable at the same time. But, every little moment of life is described in such vivid detail, it is as if the cities and the characters are walking off the pages in brilliant colour. You can’t but fall in love with the book, and it compels you to move forward to consume the next page, the next part of this young man’s life. It is a read that takes forever and yet no time at all. And it is worth every minute of one’s time.
